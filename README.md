This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function.  When combining percentages and fixed units (like pixels) within `calc()`, the order of operations can lead to unexpected results. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected approach. This issue is subtle and can be difficult to debug, particularly in complex layouts.

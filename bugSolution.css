To resolve this issue, ensure that your `calc()` expressions are unambiguous and correctly reflect the intended order of operations. If necessary, use parentheses to group calculations and enforce precedence. In the example above, adding parentheses clarifies the calculation: `width: calc(50% - 10px);`  should be written as `width: calc((50% - 10px));` to correctly apply the subtraction before calculating the percentage.  Always test your `calc()` expressions thoroughly across various browser and screen sizes.

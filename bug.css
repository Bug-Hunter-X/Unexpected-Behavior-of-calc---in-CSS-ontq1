The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, using `calc()` with percentages and other units can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the order of operations is not carefully considered. For example, if you try to calculate the width of an element as `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, the browser might interpret it incorrectly, resulting in an unexpected width.
